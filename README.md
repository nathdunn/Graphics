# Graphics
Files from the work I did in my Graphics class
The main file to look at is raytracer.cc, which is the code that takes the drivers and turns them into images (as .ppm files, viewable in gimp). 

File driver02.txt is a file that can be taken as input for raytracer.cc to make an image. Additional drivers can be created using similar specifications to those found in driver02.txt. To run the code to produce the result image, type:
"raytracer driver02.txt driver02.ppm"  (where driver02.ppm is the name of the resulting file, so you can really name it whatever you want).
